# CODEWAY
Python Programming Internship - Tasks

Task 1: Create a command-line or GUI-based application using Python, allowing users to create, update, and track their To-do lists.

In this project, I've designed a Command line To-do list application. I've tried to include output to almost all possible input 
cases that a user can enter. This project provides users with features like:
1. Create and Delete to-do lists
2. Add tasks to it
3. Delete task from it
4. Mark any task as 'done'
Here, I look forward to including the concept of file handling in the future to keep our to-do lists saved and also to try it on GUI.
