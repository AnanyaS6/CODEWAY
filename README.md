# CODEWAY
Python Programming Internship - Tasks

-> Task 1: Create a command-line or GUI-based application using Python, allowing users to create, update, and track their To-do lists.
In this project, I've designed a Command line To-do list application. I've tried including output to almost all possible input
cases a user can enter. This project provides users with features like:
1. Create and Delete to-do lists
2. Add tasks to it
3. Delete task from it
4. Mark any task as 'done'.
Here, I look forward to including the concept of file handling in the future to keep our to-do lists saved and try it on GUI.

-> Task 2: Design a simple Calculator with basic arithmetic operations
In this project, I've used GUI in Python. The basic arithmetic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are
being performed by this simple calculator

-> Task 3: Create a Password Generator application using Python, that generates strong and random passwords based on the length of 
password that the user demands.
This Project has also been done by taking GUI in use. It is a password-generating tool that builds random passwords of different 
lengths as the user demands. Password includes a mix of alphabets(lower and upper case), digits, and special symbols.
